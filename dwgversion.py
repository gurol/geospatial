"""
dwgversion.py - A Python script for parsing the version of a DWG file.

Author: GÃ¼rol Canbek
Date: 24 August 2023
Version: 1.0

Description:
This script parses the version of a DWG (Drawing) file and prints it to the console.
It supports various DWG versions from early releases to more recent ones.

Usage:
python dwgversion.py <path_to_dwg_file>

Example:
python dwgversion.py path/to/your/dwg/file.dwg

Note:
- Make sure you have Python installed.
- This script reads the first 20 bytes of the DWG file to determine its version.
- It provides human-readable versions for known DWG releases.
- If the DWG version is unknown or the file cannot be read, it will display "Unknown."
